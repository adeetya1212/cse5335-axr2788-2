1. What is your external data source used to populate your Heroku data sources?
2. What are the Heroku toolbelt commands to execute the scripts?
3. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
4. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?





1. The External data source that I have used is a local CSV file having the records of Earthquake from diffferent places.
The URL of the site is: 'http://earthquake.usgs.gov/'
There are 175 records with the ZIP CODE as PRIMARY KEY.
The attributes are: ZIP, CDI, RESPONSE, HPCDIST, LAT, LONG, SUSPECT, CITY, STATE, LOCID.

2. I have three scriprts named as: project2_postgres.rb, project2_mongo.rb, project2_redis.rb.
To execute these:
ruby project2_postgres.rb
ruby project2_mongo.rb
project2_redis.rb

3. Connecting to the databases was easy. Not a lot of work. The Redis commands hget and hset are easy to understand and execute.

4. Connecting to the Heroku Remote Database was little hard because of the lack of proper documentation around the Web. Apart from that, this was an wasy project.
